# Jar-Con VR
Hello! Welcome to the Github of my University Project! This is a piece of Virtual Reality that lets you shake a jar around with a Joycon!

This project is for the scenario "One Small Step – "A tech-heavy mini-project, focused on implementation of a concrete concept to explore practical aspects of the future of the Metaverse" - I hope to explore the practicality of using gyroscopic technology & controls to manipulate objects in a 3D space that are also impacted by gravity.

Credits: This project makes use of JoyconLib (https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib) and the libraries it incorporates under a MIT License. Joycons are produced and trademarked by Nintendo. Font used in-project is LemonMilk by Marsnev. ​Everything else was made by me.
