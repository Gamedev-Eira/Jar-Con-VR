# JoyconBottleAR
Hello! Welcome to the Github of my University Project! This is a piece of Augmented Reality that lets you shake a jar around with a Joycon!

This project is for the scenario "One Small Step â€“ A tech-heavy mini-project, focussed on implementation of a concrete concept to explore practical aspects of the future of the Metaverse" - I hope to explore the practicality of using gyroscopic technnology & controls to manipulate objects in a 3D space, although physics are also incorperated to have objects moving within the jar (or will be, as of writing this I haven't implemented that feature).

Credits:
This project makes use of JoyconLib (https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib) and the libaries it incorperates under a MIT License.
Joycons are produced and trademarked by Nintendo.
Everything else was made by me.
